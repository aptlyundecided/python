# Learn Python

This is the repository of code I will write to become a better Python developer.

By writing short programs to understand language nuances, and by doing programming challenges via r/dailyprogrammer,  I hope to sharpen my skills quickly.

I'll also be using the code living here in medium posts, regarding python.

I think I'll call it Python Fridays.
