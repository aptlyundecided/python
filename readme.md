# Python Challenges

I will create challenges here to better understand how to implement python, and in a 'pythonic' manner.

I'll also be using the code living here in medium posts, regarding python.

I think I'll call it Python Fridays.

### Challenge Descriptions

0: Load a .csv
1: Create an automation server and a client
2: send data to an automation server via an HTTP Request
3: Unit tests and function tests
x: constructors
x: Singletons
x: Factories [simple]
x: Factories part two [polymorphic]
x: Factories part three [abstract]
x: creating modules
