# Greendale Project

I am going to create a 'back end' for the most nerdy thing I've ever done in my life.

Using Python 3.6, I want to build a **Greendale Community College Simulator**.  

### What?
Greendale is a community college from the 'cancelled, then un-cancelled, then cancelled, then wait it's back again, now maybe there will be a movie about it' TV show called __Community__.  This is one of my favorite shows (not season 6), and it's got everything I need to implement design patterns.

### Why?
To teach myself every design pattern I can find.  I will represent an aspect of the TV show with each design pattern.  There may end up being some kind of real functionality here, but that is unlikely.
